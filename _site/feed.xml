&lt;!-- In response to the note got from the previous class, I re-did the design with cleaner soldering and circuit. The soldering points are further apart. This version of the circuit uses A0 as the input and 5 as PWM output.

I was so proud of the board last week that turned out to be a failure. This version works fine, but I&apos;m not so happy with the layout. The MOSFET and the potentiometer are too close to each other.

Create a fading LED attached to a micro-controller. Your LED should be interruptible by either a pushbutton, analog input, or serial input. Your fade speed and fade curve are yours to determine. Don’t use programmable LEDs for this, keep it simple and use a single-channel source. Either fade an LED directly from your micro-controller, or use a DC source.

&lt;/iframe&gt;

In this assignment, I used both the simple linear curve and the exponential curve for the fade. The LED on the top of the video is the exponential curve fade and the bottom is the simple linear curve fade. As the video shows, the two types of fades are different.
The button on the top (brown) gradually turns the lights on, and the bottom turns the lights off. When both buttons are pressed at the same time, the bulbs show a loop where the two bulbs flash with the fade on to off and back to on.

&lt;!-- This project asks us to uses an arduino and [NeoPixel jewel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2226) to create a candle.
I chose to use a Nano 33 BLE and a photocell to accomplish a torch that &quot;borrows&quot; light.

The borrowing parts were straightforward enough. I am able to program the turning on process pretty fast.
I spend some time trying to think of ways I can turn the torch off because the photocell won&apos;t be able to read a difference in light changes when the NeoPixel is on.
As Ijon suggested, there are lots of sensors in BLE that could come in handy. I ended up using the accelerometer in the BLE to program a state-change.

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/owochel/dump/tree/main\_candle/candle/candle.ino ).

The limitation of this project is that it requires some tuning in every environment. The changes in environmental lights and/or lending light sources requires a different threshold value in the code.

&lt;!--
We are making a 12v controller that allows you to manipulate 12v bulbs.
I&apos;m using the [itp labs for FQP30N06L MOSFET](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/using-a-transistor-to-control-high-current-loads-with-an-arduino/) for the circuit.

The potentiometer readings is never stable. While it is not noticeable when the bulb is bright, I found it flickers when the pot is tunned down close to off. I added a tiny resistor at the output to reduce the voltage, so it won&apos;t turn on the bulb when it is close to zero.

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/owochel/dump/tree/main\_12v/12v/12v.ino ).

For the bulb input, I used a audio jack port I found from the junk shelf. The port has two plugs that is easy to attach/remove. To reduce the chances of damage and shorts happening behind the soldering points, I also added a backing and four feet for the board.

&lt;/iframe&gt;

NOTE from after class:
The resistor ended up becoming a huge problem. It altered the current went through the bulb that results in malfunctions for all the other bulbs other than the corn cob. Lesson learned: do not alter the circuit if you don&apos;t know what you are doing.

Also, Tom told me that the GND and Volt pins on the MOSFET are too close together. Even if the soldering points are not touching, the current running through the points might short the circuit. --&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">a tactical tic tac toe game.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Quarantine, The Game</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/dump/jekyll/update/2022/01/20/quarantine.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quarantine, The Game" /><published>2022-01-20T15:50:58-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-20T15:50:58-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/dump/jekyll/update/2022/01/20/quarantine</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/dump/jekyll/update/2022/01/20/quarantine.html">&lt;p&gt;a survival game where you are quarantined in a room for 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;

![This is the schematics.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owochel/dump/main/\_final/Schematics.png)

I designed the PCB and cut. Short conclusion: it&apos;s not working.

![This is the board design in Fusion360.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owochel/dump/main/\_final/board.png)

I struggled a bit cutting the board out, but not horribly. Only one failed cut!

![Here is the final cut.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owochel/dump/main/\_final/cut.png)

I know the power jack need to be fixed to the out side of the enclosure, so I didn&apos;t solder the the power source. I did the test by touching the ground and volt holding the wire.

I don&apos;t know what could be wrong in this case, but the 7805 keep getting too hot.

I think for now, I need to focus on the code and timing of the lamp before continue doing anything with the circuit. --&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">a survival game where you are quarantined in a room for 14 days.</summary></entry></feed>
