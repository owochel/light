I designed the PCB and cut. Short conclusion: it's not working.

I struggled a bit cutting the board out, but not horribly. Only one failed cut!

I know the power jack need to be fixed to the out side of the enclosure, so I didn't solder the the power source. I did the test by touching the ground and volt holding the wire.

I don't know what could be wrong in this case, but the 7805 keep getting too hot.

I think for now, I need to focus on the code and timing of the lamp before continue doing anything with the circuit.
