a 4 people dining experience.

<!-- In response to the note got from the previous class, I re-did the design with cleaner soldering and circuit. The soldering points are further apart. This version of the circuit uses A0 as the input and 5 as PWM output.

I was so proud of the board last week that turned out to be a failure. This version works fine, but I'm not so happy with the layout. The MOSFET and the potentiometer are too close to each other.
