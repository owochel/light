Leia and I had a list of things that we want to make. The shortlisted candidates are: - Purse Light that can be decorative when not used, but the light usually helps you find your stuff in the bag - Magnetic counter light that brighten your sink in the kitchen, that can be attached to salt shaker - A reading light above your bed that has a control of a pendulum grandpa clock

In response to the note got from the previous class, I re-did the design with cleaner soldering and circuit. The soldering points are further apart. This version of the circuit uses A0 as the input and 5 as PWM output.

I was so proud of the board last week that turned out to be a failure. This version works fine, but I'm not so happy with the layout. The MOSFET and the potentiometer are too close to each other.
