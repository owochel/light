Leia and I had a list of things that we want to make. The shortlisted candidates are: - Purse Light that can be decorative when not used, but the light usually helps you find your stuff in the bag - Magnetic counter light that brighten your sink in the kitchen, that can be attached to salt shaker - A reading light above your bed that has a control of a pendulum grandpa clock

We are currently set on the third idea. We want the grandpa clock idea reserved for interactions of the light. It will be a timed task light for bed-time reading. Once the user lower one side of the string, the other side slowly get pulled down as a timer for the light.

For the form, we want a two-part solution. We want the top to be a environment light and bottom to be a reading light.

I purchased [two bulbs that can be slam fixed easily on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS3KFPD3?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). We were looking for a warm-temperature bulb. Like I didn't take the class at all, I made the mistake of thinking that the higher the temperature value(5000K) is, the warm it would be. Turns out, the one we are looking for should be 3000K. We need to test the bulbs in Leia's home since this is a lamp designed for her space.

I will be starting to make the circuit soon.
