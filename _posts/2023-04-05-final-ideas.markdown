Leia and I had a list of things that we want to make. The shortlisted candidates are: - Purse Light that can be decorative when not used, but the light usually helps you find your stuff in the bag - Magnetic counter light that brighten your sink in the kitchen, that can be attached to salt shaker - A reading light above your bed that has a control of a pendulum grandpa clock

We are currently set on the third idea. We want the grandpa clock idea reserved for interactions of the light. It will be a timed task light for bed-time reading. Once the user lower one side of the string, the other side slowly get pulled down as a timer for the light.

For the form, we want a two-part solution. We want the top to be a environment light and bottom to be a reading light.
