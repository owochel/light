I was running around 8 PM and came across this townhouse that has a beautiful door-step lamp.

The curved space make a nice reflective surface that concentrate the light. The platform, when lit, emphasizes the division of the space even when the trash can is also there to reflect the light.
The lamp shade is textured glass, casting the various shadows and concentrations of light on the textured wall. The solid cap cast the sharp shadow. However, the edges for both the concentrations and the shadows are doubled. I suspect this is caused by either **a)** multiple-sourced bulbs/corn-cob bulb inside the light, **b)** the glass refracted the light.
