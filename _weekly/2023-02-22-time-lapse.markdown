This is the time lapse shoot on go pro this morning from 6-ish to whenever the battery died. The light changed from a dim white to brighter warm yellow around second 11 in the video. The shadow of the handle is really sharp on the shades, and you can start to see the toothed edge of the bricks on the exterior wall as the shadow moves to the left. Around second 33, the shadow disappeared and reappeared after a few seconds which I assume is caused by a cloud.
