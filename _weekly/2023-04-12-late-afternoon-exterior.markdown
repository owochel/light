Prompt:
Late afternoon, exterior. Pre-sunset or sunset

I went to Arcadia last weekend. Maine is such a chill place. It was unexpectedly cold and extremely windy. This is a shot from 17:14 in the park's south bound. There weren't any clouds near us in the sky. There are a lot of pine trees in the park, as you can see in the video as well as the shadow. The wind is strong, so the tree shakes a lot. I think the scene is extra bright than I expect it to be since the sun reflects a lot form the ocean. That might also be the reason that, towards the end of the sea level, the sky is lighter colored.
